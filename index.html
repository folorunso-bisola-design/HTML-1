    <div id="reasons">
        <h1>WHY I JOINED ALTSCHOOL</h1>
            <P>While in school, I participated in a three-month Zuri program where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and worked on several projects. Completing the program helped me understand that front-end development extends far beyond these three languages. This realization motivated me to pursue a more in-depth and comprehensive education in the field, which led me to AltSchool. 
                AltSchool offers the opportunity to broaden my knowledge and refine my skills in front-end development</P>

    <h1>MY GOALS</h1>
    <P>
        I recognize that technology evolves rapidly, and I am committed to lifelong learning. As a Front-End Developer, I aim to share my knowledge with other aspiring developers while advancing in my career.

        Beyond personal growth in Front-End Engineering, my goal is to give back to the community by mentoring young individuals in underserved neighborhoods with limited access to educational resources. With the skills and network I gain at AltSchool Africa,
        I plan to develop initiatives that empower aspiring developers, creating a ripple effect of positive change through technology.
